MORE THOUGHTS ON ESTATE

NB I didn't re-read my original rules before writing this, so some details may not line up.
Yes, it's tech debt... so it can be resolved later.

Rethinking the current state of the rules as they would affect the length of gameplay
  -> I think a game should be able to be completed in 1 - 1.5 hours if you're not rushing
  -> I suspect the current ruleset would make a full game take longer than this by a significant margin
  -> The rules should clarify more about how the players are able to interact with one another, eg:
    -> Trading?
    -> Alliances?
    -> PVP combat? (see notes below)
    -> All the weird edge cases that good playtesters will inevitably find?

Contemplating some changes to the lands system - in effect, what if it was more like CK2?
  -> Each land becomes a "county," with "holding" slots
    -> Holding types: field/grange, mine, forest, town, stronghold, temple - as in current ruleset
  -> Holding slots are generic - can be improved into whatever type you can afford

New win condition: rebel against the Royal Highness and usurp the throne!
  -> Implies need to implement some kind of combat mechanic
  -> And if there's combat, then surely players must be allowed to attack each other
  -> How to allow "the throne" to defend itself?
  -> This should replace the current boring win condition (i.e. have 20 holdings being worked at once)

So, a combat mechanic!  Here is a first draft:
  -> Soldiers may be deployed from a stronghold to any holding (including other player's)
  -> If you completely occupy all the holdings in a county for a full turn, you capture the county
    -> Capture: it is added to your fief with no improvements (war is hell, after all)
  -> You must deploy more soldiers to a holding than are currently in it if you wish to capture it
    -> At least 2x more if it's a stronghold
  -> Each capture of a holding forces the loss of one soldier on each side
  -> Soldier(s) forced to "retreat" after the capture of a holding are returned to a stronghold
  -> Any holding that is occupied by soldiers, with the exception of strongholds, is non-functional

Other thoughts on PVP combat:
  -> Restrictions on who can attack each other when would probably be good
    -> Force declaration of war aims (e.g. "I declare war on player X to capture county A (or counties A, B, C)")
  -> Perhaps integrate the Royal Favor system... must solicit royal permission for war declarations?
     -> Draw X # of Favor tokens and receive different levels of Royal support based on how many of your own tokens you draw
     -> eg draw 3 tokens, you must draw at least one of your own color to be able to launch attack, but draw 3 and the RH gives you material assistance
  -> NB this could be used for the proposed "revolt/rebellion" mechanic too
    -> If you piss off the peasants enough, they occupy a holding and you have to send in the troops to crush the revolt

Currently there are two proposed win conditions: marry the Heir to the Throne, or Usurp the Throne - should there be a third?
  -> And if so, what?

Is it important to correspond each turn to a "real" length of time? Eg. months, seasons, years?
  -> Could allow for some more interesting mechanics, eg. troops can't march during winter
    -> harsh season vs. mild season - semi-random (always know the season, but don't know the intensity ahead of time)
      -> "harsh summer" - crops die vs. "mild summer" crops produce extra, for example
      -> "harsh spring" - can't plant crops vs "mild spring" each planting immediately yields
      -> etc.
  -> OTOH, yet another level of complexity and yet more things to keep track of
    -> IS IT FUN??? I don't think it would be but it might be worth playtesting

Watching "The Borgias" gets me thinking, should organized religion be more of a thing in the game?
  -> Curry favor with religious head and get bonuses
  -> Would it/could it be that different from the main "royal highness" mechanic?
  -> Again, is it fun or is it just extra shit to keep track of?
  -> Or would it seem like a glaring omission if it were left out?
