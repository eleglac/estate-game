# ESTATE
## a game of noble rank

This is a repository for works related to a board game concept I am developing.  All rights reserved to me... for now.

### Inspirations:
Downton Abbey (concept and theme)
Crusader Kings II (liege levies, general gamified knowledge of medieval nobility)
Caverna (resource management aspect, land tiles, wooden bits and bobs)
Carcassonne (haven't ever played it but I suspect there's lots of parallels)
Settlers of Catan (make sure a game is fun and not a chore)
Power Grid (resource market mechanic)
