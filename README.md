# ESTATE
## a game of noble rank

This is a repository for works related to a board game concept I am developing.  All rights reserved to me... for now.

As of 2020-10-17 I consider the basic rules and game piece requirements to be decided on for an alpha version, but see the TODOs
for more about what I think still needs to be done.

### TODOs

- Create "Royal Request" and "Royal Reward" cards in tabletop simulator, along with 
    - NB Other pieces mentioned in rules-2020-10-17 are already set up in an example TTS game
        - that is, the resource/favor tokens and land cards

- Set up TTS playtesting session(s)

- Name change (I think "Demense" will probably work better than "Estate", but might get confused with Dominion? TBD)

- Names for Lands (baronies, counties, duchies)
  - Historical? Nonsensical? Generative? TBD

- Art, art, art
    - Can't do it myself, don't want to do it myself, but it'll make or break the game IMHO
    - At least define what art is needed, eg. box art, card backs, new "icon" set, etc.
    - So, for now a Pinterest board with inspirations?
        - I'm thinking a cross between, say, Catan and Dominion and Overwatch
        - The UI style of Railway Empire is pretty close as well
        - Basically: saturated colors, flat-shaded, hand-drawn SVG look

### Inspirations:
Downton Abbey ("agonizing about pig farming? what if that were a game?!")

Crusader Kings II (liege levies, general gamified knowledge of medieval nobility)

Caverna (resource management aspect, land tiles, wooden bits and bobs)

Carcassonne (haven't ever played it but I suspect there's lots of parallels)

Settlers of Catan (make sure a game is fun and not a chore)

Power Grid (resource market mechanic)
