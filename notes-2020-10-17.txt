- The part that I keep turning over in my head is the economy bit, need to make sure i get that right but also not go full grognard or whatever.
- Playing with Tabletop Simulator has been fun!  Good way to prototype but i still want to make a physical version at some point
- Bret Devereaux's blog (acoup.blog) has been enlightening - translating the processes he describes into an abstract representation is v fun.
    - But not a game in itself!
    
Reflections on previous ideas
- MVP does NOT need a market mechanic, or gold - players can trade directly with one another if they want.  Simpler that way!
- Royal favor/requests/rewards system IS essential - basically the soul of the game right there
- MVP can lose the "marry the throne" aspect, though that's still interesting and should come back at some point
- Economy can be pared down a lot
    - "luxuries" in particular feel grafted on
    - Still like villages and castles as territory upgrades, but promoting citizens to "nobles" is unnecessary complexity
- Still no well-established win condition!
    - I liked the "usurp the throne" idea from the 9/5/20 notes but I didn't consider how it would actually be implemented
    - Big problem considering I suggest getting rid of "marry the throne" as a win
        - currently the only actual win is "twenty workers at once" which I thought (and still do think) sucks
- So, TODO: work out how to "usurp the throne"
    - Possible option: some kind of Game of Thrones "high council" mechanic?
        - eg "Master of Coin," "Master of Arms," etc. if you reach certain levels of productivity/military
            - a la "largest army" and "longest road" in Catan
        - BUT THEN WHAT?
- and, for now, live with "twenty worked holdings," god help me
- "Seasons" make sense as stages of play
- Players should NOT play simultaneous on a turn - take turns based on # of peasants (see more below in summary)
- NO PVP IN MVP, NO PEASANT REVOLTS
    - basically the only thing soldiers are used for in MVP is to gain Royal Favor
    - this will change later on, never fear
        - in fact, PVP could work like a "reverse upgrade" - go from duchy to county or county to barony
        - like title usurpation in CKII, though how to simulate casus belli? work in 'favor' system?

Major concern today: land-as-reward is likely to be crazy OP in current format
- Land is the most important thing, foundation of all other economy
- Randomly getting eg. a new duchy would totally throw off balance, make planning hard
- But any system that ties land gain to player status (i.e. # of peasants) means "the rich get richer" which is ALSO unfun

Solved(?) by not granting land, but rather land upgrades
- Not strictly historical, but lololol historicism is more of a guideline than an actual rule

Concern #2: balance of Royal Favor and Royal Requests
- Basically, need to make sure that there are always Favor tokens to distribute once the first round of requests has been filled
- Basic goal: if a player fills more requests, they should be more favored to get rewards, but NOT GUARANTEED
    - of course, if they NEVER fill requests, they will NEVER get rewards

Solved(?) by making sure requests generate more Favor tokens than are used
- Each request card has one or more requests, generating one or more favor, but each reward card only has one reward, requiring one favor
- Reward can be resources, new Counties, or Land Upgrades
- Favor will accumulate in bag as game goes on, which might be a problem
