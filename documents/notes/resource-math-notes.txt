THOUGHTS ON REQUEST/REWARD MATHS

General idea: investing in Royal Requests should be profitable, on average - but how profitable?  and in what ways?

For reference, here are the relevant notes from the rules re: quantities of each card -

- Royal Request cards
    - 1 - 3 requests per card
    - 1st request: easy (low resource requirement) 2nd medium, 3rd hard (high resource requirement)
        - so cards with 1 request are easy always, 2 requests can be kinda hard, 3 requests are damn hard to fully fill

    - 30 of these to start - 15x 1 req, 10x 2 req, 5x 3 req

- Royal Reward cards
    - A single reward per card
    - 30 of these as well - 10x land upgrade, 15x new holdings, 5x "new barony"
    - Two of these can only be got from the Royal Highness (i.e. baronies and upgrades) and Holdings are relatively resource-intensive
    - Plain resources 
    
In addition to actual named "resources," tempo is valuable
    - Both in-game and meta-game - player patience is ultimate resource (remember, it needs to be fun)
    - In-game tempo helps you win
    - Not sure how to analyze this further, except to note that royal rewards help accelerate tempo, mainly
    
HOLDING COSTS:

- GRANGE (using the word wrong, I know, I know, I'll fix it TODO fix it) - construction cost 2 wood, 1 grain (represents a farmhouse/barn and "seed" capital lolololol)
- FOREST - construction cost 1 wood 1 iron bar (represents a 'foresters hut' and tools)
- MINE - construction cost 3 wood 1 iron bar (represents mine supports and tools)
- VILLAGE - construction cost 4 wood (represents several 'core' buildings)
- CASTLE/STRONGHOLD construction cost 5 wood 2 iron (lots of wood scaffolding for building stone structures, stone implied, iron for tools AND structures)

ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES:

- Farming: (requires one peasant on a grange) 2x grain/season up to 6
- Harvest: (requires one peasant on a grange) Move grain to your stockpile
- Forestry: (requires one peasant on a forest) 2x wood (per season)
- Mining: (requires two peasants on a mine) 1x wood -> 1x iron ore (per season)
- Smithing: (requires two peasants in a Village) 2x wood, 1x iron ore -> 1x iron bar per season
- Migration: (any time in a Village) 2x grain -> 1x Peasant
- Training: (any time in a Stronghold) 1x peasant, 1x wood, 1x iron bar -> 1 soldier

The economy is set up to make iron bars a pain in the ass to get - this is intentional
Soldiers are the "peak" of the economy - require building a stronghold (needs iron) then more iron to train!
    - eg: First soldier cost: 1x stronghold (5xW 2xIB) + 1xP 1xW 1xIB -> 5xW 3xIB 1xP -> 5W + 3(3W) + 2G -> 14W 2G !
    - P <- 2G, IB <- 2W + IO, IO <- W
    - don't forget upkeep, either!
    
Generic production cost based on the idea of a "holding season" i.e. one holding worked during one season
    - eg: a single forest produces 2 wood in a season, so 2x wood takes 1 holding season (maybe just "economic action")
    - eg: 1 iron bar requires Smithing (in a Village), 1 ore (from a Mine), and 2 wood, from a Forester
        - but the ore also takes wood, so 3 wood is the total cost -> 2 forestry actions
        - so, four total actions: 1x smith, 1x mine, 2x forestry -> 4x holding seasons
        - assumes holdings already exist, though - second forest must be built earlier

Player wins when 10 holdings are worked, and each request only lasts four seasons -> provides bounds on what is reasonable to ask
So, initial balance: easy request -> 5 actions, medium request -> 7 actions, hard request -> 10 actions

The following table is a rough idea of equivalencies between different economic actions (I did the calculations in my head so who knows if they're totally right!)
    - This table assumes the "infrastructure" is in place (holdings AND peasants)
        - this takes into account the need for multiples of two peasants for multiple smelting actions in a turn
    - Grain is weird because it requires a separate "harvest" step
    - Migration, smithing, and training are not counted as "actions" because you can do them multiple times per turn (given the necessary resources)

 1 action:               2x  wood
 2 actions:  2x  grain   4x  wood    1x peasant  1x ore
 3 actions:  4x  grain   6x  wood    2x peasant  2x ore
 4 actions:  6x  grain   8x  wood    3x peasant  2x ore  1x iron bar
 5 actions:  6x  grain   10x wood    4x peasant  3x ore  1x iron bar 1x soldier
 6 actions:  8x  grain   12x wood    4x peasant  4x ore  2x iron bar 1x soldier
 7 actions:  10x grain   14x wood    5x peasant  4x ore  2x iron bar 1x soldier
 8 actions:  12x grain   16x wood    6x peasant  5x ore  3x iron bar 1x soldier
 9 actions:  12x grain   18x wood    6x peasant  6x ore  3x iron bar 2x soldier
10 actions:  14x grain   20x wood    7x peasant  6x ore  4x iron bar 2x soldier

So, as a first pass:

EASY: 0-6   grain   0-10    wood     0-3 peasants    0-2 ore     1 iron bar  
MED:  6-10  grain   10-14   wood     4-5 peasants    3-4 ore     2 iron bar  1 soldier
HARD: 10-14 grain   14-20   wood     6-7 peasants    5-6 ore   3-4 iron bar  2 soldiers   

And, given the 50 total requests on the 30 request cards, split it thus:

15 easy requests (for the 2 and 3 request cards)
20 medium requests (for the 1 and 3 request cards)
15 hard requests (for the 2 and 3 request cards)
